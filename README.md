SQL Database Project with Python and Data Visualization
This repository contains the development of a SQL database created with MySQL Workbench, integrating Python scripts using pandas for data manipulation, and visualization tools to display charts and global maps. Throughout the different practices, database queries are performed, and visual results are generated based on user preferences.

Project Structure
The project is divided into three main practices:

Practice 1: Database Creation and Population
In this practice, the following tasks are carried out:

Database creation: using MySQL Workbench.
Reading data from CSV files: using Python's pandas library.
Inserting data into the database: Scripts are used to process and load the values into the corresponding tables.

Practice 2: Queries and Data Visualization
In this practice, various SQL queries are executed to extract useful information from the database, and automatic charts are generated to show trends over time. Additionally, a recommendation algorithm is included, which allows users to obtain different options based on their preferences.

Features:
SQL queries: Queries are performed to retrieve relevant information.
Automatic charts: Using Python visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Recommendation algorithm: Based on user preferences and the queries performed.

Practice 3: Global Maps
In this final practice, global maps are used to display the geographical representation of the data extracted from the database. Tools such as Folium or Plotly are used to create interactive visualizations that show data distribution in a geographical context.

Features:
Interactive maps: Generation of maps with representative data.
